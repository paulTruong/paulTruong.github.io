## Background

Bistro Nguyen's is Vietnamese restaurant with a casual atmosphere and serves traditional Vietnamese food. Amy and Damien opened Bistro Nguyen's in 2014 but since then did not have a website. Customers would ask where they could go for more information and, without a website, there was nowhere they could go. Seeing this I approached Amy and offered to build her a website.

## Process

I started the project by finding out what the goal of the website is going to be. Through conversation with Amy and Damien, as well as taking note of the kind of questions customers would ask about the restaurant (the number one question being where to find a food and drinks menu). I determined that goal of the website was:

1.  To provide customers information about the restaurant.
2.  And by doing so, attract more customers to the restaurant.

With the goal defined and confirmed with restaurant owners Amy and Damien, discovery began. I went to many sites to see what others were doing. One of my largest inspirations was [El Burro](http://elburro.no/){: .link .underline .underline_hover}. I felt the simple and playful vibe of El Burro matched well with Bistro Nguyen's and the Bistro Nguyen's site should have a similar feeling.

The restaurant has over 70 items on it's menu, not including drinks and dessert. One of the biggest challenges was to display these items without overwhelming the user, especially on a smaller screen. In the end I decided to categorise each item on the menu and only display the items in a category as chosen by the user. That way the user would only get the information they needed. No reason to dig through 70+ items if all you want to see are what noodle dishes are available.

## Technical

The site is built on Wordpress, due to it's flexibility and the large number of plugins to extend functionality. I created custom Widget areas for the content on the Home page.Â 

There are three notable plugins used to make the site work.

*   Advanced Custom Fields
*   Instagram Feed Pro
*   WP Google Maps

Using Advanced Custom Fields, a new field group and post type is created for the items on the menu. Each menu item is given a name, description, catagory and price. By manipulating this data, I was able to build out the menu page and group the menu items by category.

Instagram Feed Pro generates the Instagram feed on the home page

WP Google Maps generates the map in the contact section.

## Final Notes

Data from analytics show that the site is getting on average 50 views a day. Not a large number by any means but it does mean there are people visiting and getting information from the site. Amy and Damien are happy that they finally have a website up and running for their business. They can now also refer customers to the site when asked where to go for more information.

Being my first 'real' project. I learnt a lot about the process from talking to clients, working with them to figure out their business goals, tying it to the website and delivering a live, functioning site to help reach that goal. All in all, this was a job well done and I am very excited to continue to refine my process and skills for the next job.
