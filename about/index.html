      <h2>Hi, I'm Paul Truong</h2>
      <br>
      I'm a web developer with a love for all things web, art and design. I used to work for the Department of Human Services, where I was a developer for the Aged Care payment systems.
      <br>      
      <br>
      Now I build websites for small businesses and individuals, helping them attract more customers and clients. All the while teaching them that the World Wide Web is not as scary or complicated as they thought.
      <br>
      <br>
      Outside of web development, I also love to play video games, read and dabble in art and design. My favourite artists are <a class="link underline underline_hover" href="https://www.instagram.com/kimjunggius/?hl=en" target="_blank">Kim Jung Gi</a> and <a class="link underline underline_hover" href="https://www.instagram.com/katsuyaterada/?hl=en" target="_blank">Katsuya Terada</a>, I just love clean linework. 
      <br>
