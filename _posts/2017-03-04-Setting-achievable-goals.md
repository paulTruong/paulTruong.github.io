Goals are hard. They're big and take a lot of effort to achieve. This post is about what I do when I set goals for myself. I hope these tips help you achieve yours. 

## Frame your goal

When deciding on a goal, be aware at how you frame your goal. A good goal is specific, it's measurable and there is a deadline.

_Get healthy_ is a bad goal. It's vague, broad and open to interpretation. At what point are you healthy? How will you know you're healthy?

Instead, think about what you can do to be healthier. Like eating healthier foods and exercise.

We can set these goals instead.

*   _No junk food in my diet by the end of this month._
*   _Work out for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week by the end of the year._

The end result is better health. But these goals are more specific, they have measures and a deadline. Which makes planning them much easier.

## Plan it out

Start with a plan. Start small into big. 

Spend some time and figure out what are the steps needed to achieve your goal. These steps, like your goal, need to be specific and achievable. Set a date and give yourself enough time to finish. These steps will act as milestones to help your reach your goal.

Using '_Cut out junk food in my diet by the end of this month.'_ as an example. We can map out some smaller milestones.

### Week 1:

*   List out what is considered as junk food
*   Limit eating from the junk food list to 5 times this week.

### Week 2:

*   Limit eating from the junk food list to 3 times this week.

### Week 3:

*   Limit eating from junk food list to once this week.

### Week 4:

*   Stop eating foods from the junk food list.
*   Success!

Not every plan will look the same. Your plan can be as basic or complex as you want. The important thing is that it provides some steps for you to take. It is up to you to figure out the steps needed to achieve your goal. 

## Write it down

Obvious but important. You can use pen and paper or software (Trello is awesome). It wasn't until I started writing down everything that I found myself being able to achieve my goals. 

By writing things down, it solidifies it in your mind. This also gives you a place to record your process and look back to when needed.

## Track and review your progress, be flexible.

Always be reviewing your progress. By reviewing you can see how close (or far, which is fine) you are to your goal. You can also use this time to change things around.  

The thing about personal goals is that everything is on you. You have full control over when you want to finish and how you go about it. You can let yourself be flexible when you need to be.  

Found a new milestone you need to achieve? Put that in. Something came up and you won't be able to meet a milestone? Push it back.  

A small warning when pushing back deadlines for a goal. Only do it when the reason is legitimate. Don't fall into the trap of pushing your deadline because you were lazy or wanted to hang with friends.  

## Summary

To summarise my tips above.

1.  Frame your goal, make it specific and measurable
2.  Plan it out, start small, build big.
3.  Write everything down.
4.  Track and review your progress, be flexible, don't be afraid to change your plan but do take care if you do.

Achieving goals you set for yourself isn't easy and as with most things, it shouldn't be. It'll take a lot of hard work to achieve any goal worth achieving. I hope that these tips will make it a little easier to achieve yours.
